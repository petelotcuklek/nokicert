#summary Build instructions for NokiCert

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" /> 

== Requirements ==
  * Ant
  * Java 6 (Sun or OpenJDK)
  * [http://www.bluecove.org BlueCove] Bluetooth Java library (`bluecove.jar`)
    * For Linux you also need `bluecove-gpl.jar` and `bluecove-bluez.jar`
  * [http://www.eclipse.org/swt SWT] (graphics library for your platform)

== Building ==

Generic instructions:
{{{
$ ant doc dist \
    -Dbluecove.jar=/path/to/bluecove-VERSION.jar \
    -Dswt.jar=/path/to/swt-PLATFORM-VERSION.jar
}}}

This compiles both NokiCert and creates the API documentation.

== Running ==

The directory `misc` of the source package and SVN repository contains launch scripts 
for different platforms. They set the correct `CLASSPATH` before launching the 
`net.tuxed.nokicert.NokiCertGUI` class. These scripts are used by the binary release, so
one will have to modify the paths to the supporting libraries.
