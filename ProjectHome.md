NokiCert makes it possible to install X.509 certificates on Nokia S40 phones.
It can install certificates for accessing SSL protected websites as well as for
authenticating MIDlet suites to place them in the identified (trusted) third
party domain. It uses a Bluetooth connection to the phone to install the
certificates. Most S40 phones (assuming they have a certificate database) will
work.

NokiCert is written in Java and runs on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.
